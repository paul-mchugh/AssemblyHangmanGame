## Hangman in assembly

I implemented a game of hangman using assembly.
The game is officially called EXECUTION.
After six wrong guesses of letters the prisoner gets the guillotine.

### Features

Uses VT100 color codes to colorize text.
Has great performance.  Can even be run on a potato.
Words are case insensitive.
Contains a great ASCII art guillotine.
100% more hope of escaping execution compared to Napoleonic France.

### Specifics

Written in AT&T GAS Syntax
Only runs on linux
