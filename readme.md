## Hangman in assembly

I implemented a game of hangman using assembly.  
The game is officially called EXECUTION.  
After six wrong guesses of letters the prisoner gets the guillotine.  

### Features

Uses VT100 color codes to colorize text.  
Has great performance.  Can even be run on a potato.  
Words are case insensitive.  
Contains a great ASCII art guillotine.  
100% more hope of escaping execution compared to Napoleonic France.  

### Specifics

Written in AT&T GAS Syntax  
Only runs on linux  

### Assembly Instructions

Run the script titled ```assemble_and_link``` to assemble and link the program.
